# Multiclass semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3+

## Introduction 

Semantic segmentation, with the goal to assign semantic labels to every pixel in an image, is an essential computer vision task. In this example, I implement the DeepLabV3+ model for multi-class semantic segmentation, a fully-convolutional architecture that performs well on semantic segmentation benchmarks.
